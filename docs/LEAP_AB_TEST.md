# Leap Impact — Wedge Flow (Default)

The Leap Impact tool uses a progressive disclosure flow to reduce friction:

1. **Step 0:** Hero + CTA "Check my setup →" (no form visible)
2. **Step 1:** Salary only
3. **Step 2:** State, match, 401k % → "Show my best move"

This replaced the previous full-form-on-load design after A/B testing showed improved engagement.
